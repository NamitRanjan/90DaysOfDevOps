# Day 16 – Shell Scripting Basics

## Scripts Created
- hello.sh
- variables.sh
- greet.sh
- check_number.sh
- file_check.sh
- server_check.sh

---

## Example Output

hello.sh:
Hello, DevOps!

variables.sh:
Hello, I am Namit and I am a DevOps Engineer

greet.sh:

---

## Commands Used
chmod +x
echo
read
if / else
systemctl
bash script.sh

## What I Learned

- Shebang defines which shell runs the script.
- Variables store reusable values in scripts.
- if-else logic allows scripts to make decisions.
