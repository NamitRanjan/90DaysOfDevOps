## **🌱 90-Day DevOps Learning Plan – By Namit Ranjan**

### **1. My Current Level**

I am a **working professional** currently building foundational skills in DevOps and Cloud Engineering. I have basic understanding of Linux, Git, and general software development concepts, but I am starting my DevOps journey with a structured, disciplined approach.

### **2. My Understanding of DevOps & Cloud Engineering**

To me, **DevOps** means a culture and set of practices that bring development and operations together to deliver software faster, reliably, and at scale.  
**Cloud Engineering** enables applications to run on scalable, automated infrastructure using platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP.

Together, these fields focus on automation, reliability, continuous delivery, and building systems that can handle real-world workloads.
